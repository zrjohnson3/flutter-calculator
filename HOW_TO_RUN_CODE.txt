I was unable to run code after reguarly cloning the project, even tho it runs fine in the previous project. 

I saw on discord Joe D said that we need to move the preojct outside of the new folder that was created when initilzing and pushing to the github repo

After moving the project outisde of the flutter-calculator folder, my project ran fine again. 

This was an interesting bug. I was not able to get the terminal to regonize that the files were there.
